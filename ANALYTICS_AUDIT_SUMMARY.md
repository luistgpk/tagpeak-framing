# Analytics Dashboard Audit - Executive Summary

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Current State**: The dashboard provides solid statistical analysis but lacks actionable insights for communication strategy.

**Main Problem**: Shows *what* happened but not *why* or *what to do about it*.

**Key Gap**: Missing segmentation insights, text analysis, and barrier identification that would directly inform TagPeak's email communication strategy.

## 🔴 Top 5 Critical Issues

### 1. **No Actionable Segmentation**
- **Problem**: Shows overall winner but not "who should get which message"
- **Impact**: Can't personalize communication
- **Fix**: Build user scoring algorithm + segmentation profiles

### 2. **Weak Text Analysis**
- **Problem**: Only word frequency, no thematic analysis
- **Impact**: Don't know what users actually think or what concerns them
- **Fix**: Thematic coding of manipulation thoughts and concerns

### 3. **Incomplete Moderation Analysis**
- **Problem**: Basic high/low splits, no proper interaction tests
- **Impact**: Can't identify which segments respond to which frames
- **Fix**: Proper 2-way ANOVA with simple effects analysis

### 4. **No Barrier Prioritization**
- **Problem**: Generic concern list, no prioritization
- **Impact**: Don't know which concerns to address first
- **Fix**: Analyze concerns by frequency × impact, link to intention

### 5. **Missing Communication Metrics**
- **Problem**: Academic outcomes only, not communication effectiveness
- **Impact**: Can't measure if messages are working
- **Fix**: Add comprehension, trust, engagement breakdown metrics

## ✅ What's Working Well

- Solid statistical foundation (ANOVA, effect sizes)
- Good visual presentation
- Comprehensive outcome coverage
- Data quality checks

## 🎯 What's Truly Useful for Communication Strategy

### Priority 1: Actionable Segmentation
**Question**: Who should get which message?
**Answer Needed**: "User profile X → Use Frame Y with Z% confidence"

### Priority 2: Message Element Analysis
**Question**: What drives responses?
**Answer Needed**: Themes, sentiment, risk perception by frame

### Priority 3: Barrier Identification
**Question**: What's blocking adoption?
**Answer Needed**: Prioritized concerns with solutions

### Priority 4: Communication Effectiveness
**Question**: Are messages working?
**Answer Needed**: Comprehension, trust, engagement metrics

### Priority 5: Website-Email Alignment
**Question**: How do email and website work together?
**Answer Needed**: Content alignment, journey funnel, recommendations

## 📊 Key Questions Dashboard Should Answer

1. **Which email frame should we use?** → By segment, with confidence
2. **Who should get which message?** → Clear segmentation profiles
3. **What concerns should we address?** → Prioritized with solutions
4. **What should the website say?** → Content recommendations
5. **How do we differentiate?** → Competitive positioning analysis
6. **What message elements work?** → Word/phrase-level analysis
7. **How do we improve comprehension?** → Specific gaps and solutions
8. **What's the user journey?** → Detailed funnel with drop-offs
